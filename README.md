## Course Deliverable

    • Exam code: "A"
    • Due Monday, December 8, 2024, 9:00am

## `classDocs/`

All materials (i.e., slides, code, data and other resources) given out in class will be archived in the `classDocs/` repository which is hosted on GitHub. To clone this repository (i.e., making a local copy of all materials on your own machine) use the command; `git clone git@github.com:AlleghenyCollege-CIS-301-F2025/classDocs.git`. You will only have to do this once to create this local copy, however, you may make other copies of the `classDocs/` repository, if your previous copy of the repository becomes corrupt for some reason.

To update your local repository (i.e., to get the latest slides and resources), use the following command from the directory of the repository on your local machine; `git pull`. This command will check to see what updates are available online to download them to your machine.

## Course Description

A study of computational methods of data analysis with an emphasis on understanding and reflecting on the social, cultural, and political issues surrounding data and its interrogation. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students study, design, and implement analytics software and learn how to build predictive models with foundational machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge from various sources of data. Students also investigate the biases, discriminatory views, and stereotypes that may be present during the collection and analysis of data, reflecting on the ethical implications of using the resulting machine learning techniques. During a weekly laboratory session, students use Industry-grade open source statistical software to complete projects, reporting on their findings through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: CMPSC*101 or CMPSC*102. 

## Distribution Requirements

- __PD__: _Power, Privilege, & Difference_. Understanding Power, Privilege, & Difference means understanding the role of power, privilege, prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, inequity, and oppression in human society, in both historical and contemporary contexts, and recognizing these dynamics in the learner’s own life and communities.

  - __Learning Outcome__: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the historical and/or contemporary roles of power, privilege, and difference in human society.

- __QR__: _Quantitative Reasoning_. Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

  - __Learning Outcome__: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic representations.

## Course Objectives

Students successfully completing this class will have developed:

- A “big-picture” view of data science.
- An understanding of the objectives and limitations of data analytics.
- An understanding of the main methods in data science for analytical goals.
- Practical skills using relevant software tools and programming techniques.
- An understanding of the contemporary roles of power and difference as they relate to the knowledge derived from a data set.
- An understanding of biases, discrimination and stereotypes that maybe present during collection, analysis, and reflection on the latent trends in real-world data sets.
- The course is divided into modules, with several of the modules consisting of investigations of real-world data in a specific field. In addition to learning specific technical and programming skills in each module students will be required to read a relevant article and prepare for a discussion related to the issues raised in the article.
- Students will also enhance their ability to write and present ideas about data analytics in a clear and compelling fashion. Finally, students will gain practical experience in the design, implementation, and analysis of data for research during laboratory sessions and a final project.

## An Ethical Interest

Throughout the semester students will be challenged with serious analytical questions connecting the investigated data and its analysis to arising societal issues of bias, ethical consideration and the culture of power. This step is to ensure that analytics is performed with a lens on the data, as well as its impacts (positive and negative) on culture, community, and society. We note here that there is often no clear indication of a “correct” decision as a result of an analysis of data. The so-called “right” decision ought to be made by analysis who has studied both the data, and the consequences of decision in terms of humanitarian, environmental, ecological and other factors. This class cannot give you the correct decision, however it can help to enable your critical thinking skills which will provide you with some understanding of how to navigate to worthy decisions.

|D+| 67 - 69.9  |D|  63 - 69.9 |F | 62.9 and below |

### Definitions of Grading Categories

- __Class Participation__: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required reading assignments, completing in-class exercises, asking constructive questions of the other members of the class, giving presentations, leading a discussion session in class.

- __Activities__: Students are offered challenges to test their understanding of material from the course and textbook. Challenges include programming concepts, data handling, approaches to analysis, interpretation, in addition to other types of skills that are intimately associated to data science. Unless other information is given about a due date, activities are to be completed by the end of class.

- __Exams__: Exams will cover all of the material in their associated module(s) up to the time of the exam. The finalized date for each of the exams will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, in absence of special arrangements, all students will be expected to take the exam at the scheduled date and complete it during the allotted time.

- __Laboratory Assignments__: These assignments invite students to explore the concepts, tools, and techniques associated with the analysis of data. All of the laboratory assignments require the use of the provided tools to study, design, implement, and evaluate systems that solve data analytics problems. In addition
 to demonstration of the technical skills through the utilized or developed software for data analysis, some of the laboratory assignments in this course may also expect students to read a related article and to lead a discussion or to give a short presentation related to the assigned article.

- __Final Project__: This project will present you with the description of a problem and ask you to implement a full-featured solution using a wide variety of data analytics techniques. The final project in this class will require you to apply all of the knowledge and skills that you have accumulated during the course of the semester to solve a problem and, whenever possible, make your solution publicly available as a free and open-source tool. The project will invite you to draw upon both your problem solving skills and data analytics techniques.

### Assignment Submissions

Your instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use `git` to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.

The three basic commands for submitting work are the following.

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "informative message"
git push
```

**Please do not email your work to the instructor.**

### Course Tokens

In our course, students are permitted to utilize two tokens to extend deadlines for assignments and tests (not final projects). The application of a token typically does not require interaction with the course instructor, except in extraordinary circumstances such as those documented as severe and extenuating or those that breach the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.

The rationale behind the use of tokens is outlined in our departmental [policy](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/).

To utilize a token, students must first submit a Google form at least 24 hours prior to the deadline passing. Exceptions can be made for severe or extenuating circumstances, as well as instances that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.

It is important to note that the use of tokens grants an extension of only one week for all coursework, with the exception of the final project, which is fixed by the College.

For questions regarding the application and usage of tokens, students are encouraged to check the departmental policy documentation, or reach out to the course instructor for clarification.

### Gradebook Repository

GradeBook repository will be used to deliver your grades from your activities and labs to you. In this repository, you will find a file which contains the same information that the instructor has in the gradebook. While it is a repository that you will `pull` from, you will never need to `push` anything to this repository.

Please use the following URL to create your gradebook repository; [https://classroom.github.com/a/txKMvADl](https://classroom.github.com/a/txKMvADl).

### Bring your own computer to class

The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.

During the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following [resource](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/).

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

#### Class Deans (prepared by MCSS)

The [Office of Class Deans](https://sites.allegheny.edu/maytum-center-student-success/class-deans/) in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don’t know who to ask – ask a class dean. If you want advice – talk to a class dean. Aacha Gregg is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Carene Shipley is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Dom Turner is the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, located in Schultz Hall. Please contact them individually or through `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Recording Policy (prepared by Campus Life and Community Standards Committee)

In remote teaching and learning contexts, there is an understanding that instructors (including faculty, coaches, staff, and facilitators) have the right to record class and discussion proceedings.  All other participants must request permission of the instructor in advance before making any additional recordings.  An instructor's pre-recorded material, including lectures and class notes, may not be shared with anyone outside of the course's current enrollment without the consent of the instructor. Similarly, under no circumstances may a recording, still, screenshot, picture, or any other media of any sort be altered or circulated by anyone outside of its original intent. No content may be distributed outside the circle of participants without the consent of all who appear or are heard. The college community is reminded of Allegheny College's Recording Policy, outlined in 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook, as well as Allegheny's Statement of Community. Violations will be referred to the Student Conduct system.  Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through the Student Accessibility and Support Services. Faculty are further reminded that recordings of class activities are educational records protected under FERPA. While students do not have a right to be anonymous in a class in which they are enrolled, they have the legal right to be anonymous to third parties. Please direct questions about FERPA to the Registrar.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting (prepared by the Title IX Coordinator)

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.
